## Hello I am Kerem.

------------


- ***I have been interested in software for 1 year***

- ***I started the software with Python and continued by learning html, css ,javascript and java.***

- ***I currently know Python and Java at an intermediate or advanced level. I think I have improved myself in html and css. I learned Bootstrap.***

- ***At the same time, we are currently learning SpringBoot and Microservice with a Java developer team.***

- ***I'm on my way to becoming a Fullstack web developer. But my main goal is to learn ML and AI. I'm more young.I believe that if I don't die, I will be very successful in both..:))***
